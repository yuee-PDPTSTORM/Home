    				<h2> History</h2>
    				
    					<p> Ernest Rutherford first commenced his significant Gold Foil Experiment in 1909. Based on this experiment, he concluded that The Atom is mostly empty space with a tiny, dense, positively charged Atomic Nucleus. Using the data collected from his experiments, he created a Nuclear Diagram of An Atom. However, his nuclear model was soon improved and perfected by Niels Bohr in 1913, who expressed the Idea of Electron Orbits. Niels Bohr proposed an early model of The Atom as A Central Nucleus containing Protons and Neutrons being orbited by Electrons in Shells. As previously discussed, there is a connection between Proton Configuration in an element, The Atomic Number that distinguishes one element from another, and The Electron Configuration it has. In all electrically-neutral Atoms, The Electron Configuration is the same as The Proton Configuration. Each element, when electrically neutral, has a number of Electrons equal to its Atomic Number. Bohr was the one who developed an early Nuclear Model consisting of Electron Orbits, and thus, it evolved into The Bohr-Rutherford Diagram that is commonly known as of today, current, and modern times.</p>

    				<h2> What is The Bohr-Rutherford Diagram?</h2>
    				
    					<p> In Atomic Physics, The Bohr-Rutherford Diagram, presented in 1913 by Niels Bohr and Ernest Rutherford, is a system consisting of a small, and dense Atomic Nucleus consisting of Protons and Neutrons surrounded by Orbiting Electrons. It shows the Orbital Shells with an estimated distance of Attraction provided by Electrostatic Forces. The Diagram is a system that can give a rough representation of the composition and configurations of The Subatomic Particles within the certain Elementary Atom. There are a variety of forms that this system model is produced in. This is the basic information on The Bohr-Rutherford Diagram.</p>
