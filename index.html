						<p>	The Periodic Table, also known as The Periodic Table of Elements, is a tabular display of the chemical elements, which are arranged by atomic number/proton configuration in the nucleus, and recurring chemical properties, such as electronegativity or reactivity. The structure of the table categorizes elements and shows periodic trends. If we are to understand an Element on The Table, we need to know the atomic number, mass number, charges, and proton, neutron, and electron configurations, as well as the element catgory it is in. The Elements are categorized into groups and periods, the columns and rows respectively, and they can categorize elements in their many different aspects. Every element in the image shown has its symbol and element names, atomic number, and atomic mass displayed.</p>
		
					<h2>What is an Element?</h2>
		
						<p>	An Element on the Table are completely pure of substance and cannot be separated by any means because they are atom singularities that are indivisible, unlike pure compounds which can't necessarily be separated into simpler substances by physical means, but by separation of the molecules consisting of different elemental atoms through chemical means. The Element on The Table only has its atomic and mass number displayed with the name and symbol of the element, but there are many other aspects of the element that aren't displayed. This website will show most if not all common aspects of an element!</p>
	
					<h2>What is an Atomic Number and a Proton?</h2>
		
						<p> A Proton is a stable subatomic particle occurring in all atomic nuclei, with a positive electric charge equal in magnitude to that of an electron, but of opposite sign. It is represented in diagrams as (p+). Every different element has a different amount of protons in their respective atom's nucleus. Protons have a positive charge contradictory to that of the negative charges of The Electrons. Therefore, The Elements can be categorized by their proton configuration, thus making the Atomic Number in the top left of each element in the diagram shown above. The Atomic Number represents The Proton Configuration and it is a pattern and categorization found within the structure of The Table.</p>
		
					<h2>What is Mass Number and a Neutron?</h2>
		
						<p> A Neutron is a subatomic particle of about the same mass as a proton but without an electric charge, present in all atomic nuclei except those of ordinary hydrogen because Hydrogen has identical Mass and Atomic Numbers. It is represented in diagrams as (n0). The Neutrons in a atomic nucleus may not be the same as The Proton Configuration, and they are found by subtracting the Atomic Number from The Rounded Mass Number of The Atom Sample. The Mass Number or Atomic Mass is the mass as it says, and it is the total of Proton and Neutron Configurations together in a certain nucleus. The Neutron Configuration varies in a range because of the variety in range of The Mass Number. The Mass number is rounded to the nearest whole when used to subtract The Atomic Number from it. The Mass Number shown on the diagram at the bottom of each element is the most common mass number and represents the average of the range. It also has a correlation with The Atomic Number, therefore also being a structural pattern and categorization visible within The Table.</p> 
		
					<h2>What is an Electron?</h2>
		
						<p> An Electron is a stable subatomic particle with a charge of negative electricity, and is found in all atoms and acting as the primary carrier of electricity in solids. It is represented in diagrams as (e-). It is found revolving around the atomic nuclei. If Electron Configuration is changed through the addition or subtraction of one, then that can make produce a positive charge through subtraction and a negative charge through addition. The Electron is a referred to as a more singular quality among atoms.</p>
		
					<p> There are many more ways in which The Chemical Elements can be categorized to contribute in the formation of The Periodic Table. Extra Information, Descriptions, and History on The Periodic Table of Elements are available at <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table" >The Periodic Table</a> on The Wikipedia.</p>
