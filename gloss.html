    				<h2>How are Elements Categorized?</h2>
    					
    					<p>	The Elements on The Periodic Table have specific categorization based on their chemical properties, consisting of things such as ionic charges, electronegativity, and radioactivity. The Periodic Table of Elements would ultimately be categorized in a way that would be able to express and display all these chemical properties of the elements in a proper sequence that would be periodic trends. The expressions and display of these periodic trends are specifically categorized in The Groups/Columns and The Periods/Rows of The Periodic Table to show a proper and consistent sequence of periodic trends.</p>
    						
    				<h2> What are Ionic Charges, Electronegativity, Radioactivity, and Valence Shells?</h2>
    					
    					<p> Ionic Charges, Electronegativity, Radioactivity, and Valence Shells, are all chemical properties of some selective elements. 
    						
    					<h3> Ionic Charges</h3>
    							
    						<p> An Ionic Charge is an electrical charge of an Ion, where the Electron Count will not be equal to the Proton Count, which will subsequently give it either a positive charge with the loss of an electron or a negative charge with the gain of an electron. Elements with charges will be represented as Element Symbol(n+ or n-), where n is the charge and n= Number of Electrons + n. Not all charges for a specific element are electrically stable for suitability though, and some elements usually have only a few realistic charges. Some versions of The Periodic Table will display common stable charges of certain elements.</p>
    						
    					<h3> Electronegativity</h3>	
    					
    						<p> Electronegativity is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons, otherwise known as Electron Density, towards itself. An Atom's electronegativity is affected by both its specific atomic number and the distance at which its Valence Shell Electrons reside from the Charged Nucleus consisting of The Protons and Neutrons. The higher the associated and respective electronegativity number, the more an atom its electrons towards itself, whereas Electropositivity is the measure of the ability of Elements (Mainly Metals) to donate Electrons to form Positive Ions. The Elements that can easily accept electrons to form Negative Ions are called electronegative elements. It is simply and basically the measure of how strongly atoms attract bonding electrons to themselves. While factors such as Proton Configuration/Atomic Number, Nuclear and Ionic Charges may have a small effect on electronegativity, the basic factor that determines an atomic element's electronegativity is the distance from the Charged Nucleus consisting of The Protons and Neutrons, and The Atomic Orbital Shells consisting of The Electrons. If the Element has Valence Shell Electrons that are farther away in distance from The Atomic Nucleus, then The Electrons will receive less control from positive charge donations of The Protons, therefore this distance will increase the reactivity of The Element and thus, making the Electronegativity Number smaller.</p>
    						
    					<h3> Radioactivity</h3>
    					
    						<p> Radioactivity is the emission of ionizing radiation or elementary decaying particles from atoms caused by the spontaneous disintegration of unstable atomic nuclei. Some Elements on The Periodic Table are found to be radioactive and can release high amounts of energy or emit many particles. There will be a respective symbol close to the respective element that will be an indication that the respective element is radioactive. The symbol will look like the content of this image below.</p>
    						
    						<img src="images/RadioactiveSymbol.jpg" width="1020" height="690" alt="Nuke" class="box"/>
    						
    					<h3> Valence Shell Electrons</h3>
    					
    						<p> Valence Shells are the outermost orbital shells of an atom, and the farthest shell ring in distance from the charged atomic nucleus. An Atomic Orbital Shell can have a maximum of 2 Electrons in the first shell and a maximum of 8 Electrons as a full shell in its other shells. The amount of Electrons in each orbital shell is illustrated in The Bohr-Rutherford Diagrams on the webpage about <a href = "matte.html">History of The Bohr-Rutherford Diagram</a>. The Electrons in The Valence Shells known as Valence Electrons don't receive a lot of effect from factors and subatomic particles residing in the atom itself, such as proton charge, because they are the farthest in distance from The Nucleus consisting of The Protons, but they may receive effect from other atoms if they are part of a molecular compound, in which Electrons may be delivered to other atoms depending on the type of compound.</p>
    						
    				<h2> Element Categorizations by Groups and Periods</h2>

						<p> Elements are specifically categorized into a proper sequence in order to display and express the properties and periodic trends of every single element. The Periods, otherwise known as the rows of The Periodic Table, are widely known to play the role of displaying the elements in a sequence that addresses Proton Configuration/Atomic Number, and Mass Number, which has correlation with The Neutron Configuration within The Nucleus, as well it determines The Number of Atomic Orbital Shells. However, The Groups, otherwise known as the columns of The Periodic Table, also play a main and significant role in displaying the elements. The Groups mostly focus on categorizing the elements in, as the name suggests, groups! These Groups each reside in their respective columns, and their groups mainly categorize the elements based on the chemical properties of the respective elements. The Groups of Elements will be displayed below with their properties.</p>
						
						<h3> Alkali Metals</h3>
						
							<p> The Alkali Metals are found in the first column of The Periodic Table, otherwise known as Group 1 or Group 1A. They are mainly defined by their silvery, lustrous, and soft physical look and their incredibly high reactivity, but they also have attributes like low density and temperature melting points, as well as an easy ionization process. The Elements residing in this category only have 1 Electron in their Valence Shells that is loose and unstable and creates reactive charges. They are also electropositive and monovalent metals forming strongly alkaline hydroxides.</p>
							
						<h3> Alkaline Earth Metals</h3>
						
							<p> The Alkaline Earth Metals are found in the second column of The Periodic Table, otherwise known as Group 2 or Group 2A. They are mainly defined by their shiny and silvery-white physical look and a somewhat medium-high reactivity at standard temperature and pressure factors. They have average density, temperature melting points, and ionization processes. The Elements that are in this category are also reactive due to the fact that there are 2 loose and unstable Electrons in The Valence Shells that are responsible for reactive charges. They are also electropositive and divalent metals, and form basic oxides which react with water to form comparatively insoluble hydroxides.</p>	
							
						<h3> Transition Metals</h3>
						
							<p> The Transition Metals are simply the metals that commonly found within the middle of The Periodic Table. They are metallic elements that serve as a connection and transition, as the name suggests, between the 2 opposite sides of The Table. Here are some general properties of these Transition Metals. They have a large charge/radius ratio, and they are hard and have high densities, high melting and boiling points, and they form compounds which are often paramagnetic or with profound catalytic activity, coloured ions and compounds, and stable complexes. They also show variable oxidation states. These are some common general properties of the many of these metals. Most of these metals are rare and precious, but there is a section called The Basic Metals, which are more common metals that can be readily extracted.</p>
							
						<h3> Non-Metals</h3>
						
							<p>	Non-Metals are located on the far right side of the periodic table, except Hydrogen, which is located in the top left corner. They are generally poor conductors of heat and electricity and solid Non-Metals are generally brittle, non-malleable or non-ductile, with little or no metallic lustre, as they are dull. Most Non-Metals have the ability to gain electrons easily if they are in Ionic Compounds. Non-Metals can display a wide range of chemical properties and reactivities. They also consist of The Halogens and Noble Gases.</p>
							
						<h3> Metalloids/Semi-Metals</h3>
						
							<p> Metalloids, or Semi-Metals, are elements that have properties that are intermediate between those of Metals, Non-Metals that are Solidified, and Semi-Conductors. They are arranged in a line that looks like a staircase on The Periodic Table of Elements.</p>
						
						<h3> Halogens</h3>
						
							<p> The Halogens are located in the seventeenth column of The Periodic Table, otherwise known as Group 17 or Group 7A. They are mainly defined by their ability to form Strongly Acidic Compounds with Hydrogen from which simple salts can be produced. They are also reactive, non-metallic elements, and display physical and chemical properties typical of Non-Metals. They have relatively low melting and boiling points that increase steadily down The Group. Near Room Temperature, The Halogens span all of the Physical States of Matter and are diatomic, electronegative, and the speed in which they gain Electrons is the most agile, making them the most chemically reactive group of elements. They also have energy that is easily ionized and released from Electron Affinity. All Halogens have 7 Electrons in their Valence Shells, which is a somewhat stable and tight amount. These are properties of The Halogens.</p>
						
						<h3> Noble Gases</h3>
						
							<p> The Noble Gases are located in the eighteenth column of The Periodic Table, otherwise known as Group 18 or Group 8A. They are mainly defined by how chemically unreactive they are, even though they can still be reactive and even radioactive . Under standard conditions, they are monatomic gases that have qualities such as being odourless and colourless. Because of their properties, they can't be manipulated for usage easily. All Noble Gases have a Full Valence Shell of 8 Electrons, which means the Electrons in the Shells are tight, packed, and very stable. They won't produce charge.</p>
						
						<h3> Lanthanide and Actinide Series</h3>
						
							<p> These 2 series serve as The Inner Two Series of The Transition Metals. Lanthanides exhibit strong electromagnetic and light properties because of the presence of unpaired electrons in the orbitals. The majority of the Lanthanides are paramagnetic, which means that they have strong magnetic fields. Actinides are a series of heavy radioactive, dense, and fairly soft metallic elements of increasing atomic number that tarnish in the air considered to be analogous to the Lanthanide Series of Elements, and they are also highly electropositive, have distinctive structures, and they react with boiling water or dilute acid to release hydrogen gas. These are the main properties of the 2 prominent Series in The Periodic Table.</p> 
						
						<h3> Newly Discovered Elements</h3>
						
							<p> Newly Discovered Elements are Elements Atomic Number=> 113, 115, 117, and 118 that have very little personal information about their properties because they are so rare. Their Unknown Forms are referred to as Ununtrium(Uut), Ununpentium(Uup), Ununseptium(Uus), and Ununoctium(Uuo). They have actually been found as The Elements, Nihonium(Nh), Moscovium(Mc), Tennessine(Ts), and Oganesson(Og), respectively. They have very limited data because these elements are so rare that they currently have less than 10 of each atom discovered on Planet Earth for examination.</p>
						
					<h2> Ionic and Covalent Compounds</h2>
					
						<p> Ionic Compounds are formed from strong electrostatic interactions between Ions, which result in higher melting points and electrical conductivity compared to Covalent Compounds. Covalent compounds have bonds where Electrons are shared between Atoms. Ionic Compounds are Molecular Compounds composed of a Metal and a Non-Metal, and therefore it may have a Charged Ion due to Electron Donation. Covalent Compounds are Molecular Compounds that composed of 2 Non-Metals bounded together, therefore The Electrons are shared among The Atoms.</p>	
						
					<h2> Ions and Isotopes</h2>
					
						<p> Ions are Atoms with Charge, which means that The Orbital Electron Configuration	will not be equal to The Proton Configuration residing in The Atomic Nucleus, therefore (p+ is greater than e-) or (p+ is less than e-) in order for The Atom to be an Ion. An Isotope is an Atom that has a different Neutron Configuration compared to The Proton Configuration inside The Nucleus. The inequality is solely affected by what The Mass Number is going to be. (p+ is greater than n0) or (p+ is less than n0) in order for an Atom to be An Isotope.</p>
